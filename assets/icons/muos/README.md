# muOS Logo Usage

This repository includes SVG assets derived from the [MustardOS project](https://github.com/MustardOS/asset).

- [`logo.svg`](logo.svg) is an unmodified copy of [`assets/mustardOS - Swirl Logo - Colour.svg`](https://github.com/MustardOS/asset/blob/78b1bb853fda49b7a989d300262152dca506e099/mustardOS%20-%20Swirl%20Logo%20-%20Colour.svg). This file is not my original work.
- [`logo_outline.svg`](logo_outline.svg) is a derivative work based on [`assets/mustardOS - Swirl Logo - Outline.svg`](https://github.com/MustardOS/asset/blob/78b1bb853fda49b7a989d300262152dca506e099/mustardOS%20-%20Swirl%20Logo%20-%20Colour.svg). This version has been modified to remove the letter "M" from the inner portion of the logo.
- The modified [`logo_outline.svg`](logo_outline.svg) is used as a base for creating images for user-generated themes (images displayed when rebooting, charging, and shutting down).
